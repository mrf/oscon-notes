# Notes from OSCON 2014

## Just Enough Math
Paco Nathan

Move in late 90's defensibility -> predicatibility
- social sciences math -> physics math
- servers scale on commodity hardware (amazon, ebay, yahoo, google)
- data modeling -> algorithmic modeling
  - hundreds of predictive models (Netflix Prize)

Abstract Algebra
- can avoid bottlenecks by compilers computing algebra

Functional Programming
- less resources spent on sorting
- parralelism much easier

Probabilistic Data Structures
- "Hash, don't sample"
